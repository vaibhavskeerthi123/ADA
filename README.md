  - [SelectionSort.exe](#lab-2-selectionsortexe): Executable file for Windows.
  - [SelectionSortGraph.pdf](#lab-2-selectionsortgraphpdf): Performance graph showing execution time for various input sizes.
  - [SelectionSortOutput.png](#lab-2-selectionsortoutputpng): Sample output screenshot.

### Lab 3
- **Merge Sort Implementation**
  - [MergeSort.c](#lab-3-mergesortc): Implements merge sort using the divide and conquer method.
  - [MergeSort.exe](#lab-3-mergesortexe): Executable file for Windows.
  - [MergeSortGraph.pdf](#lab-3-mergesortgraphpdf): Performance graph illustrating merge sort execution time.
  - [MergeSort_vs_SelectionSort_Graph.pdf](#lab-3-mergesort_vs_selectionsort_graphpdf): Comparative graph analyzing merge sort versus selection sort performance.

### Lab 4
- **Quick Sort Implementation**
  - [QuickSort.c](#lab-4-quicksortc): Implements quick sort using the divide and conquer method.
  - [QuickSort_vs_MergeSort_Graph.pdf](#lab-4-quicksort_vs_mergesort_graphpdf): Comparative graph analyzing quick sort versus merge sort performance.

### Lab 5
- **Prim's Algorithm**
  - [Prims.c](#lab-5-primsc): Implements Prim's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in a weighted graph.
  - [PrimsOutput.png](#lab-5-primsoutputpng): Sample output screenshot showing the MST.

### Lab 6
- **Knapsack Problem**
  - [Knapsack.c](#lab-6-knapsackc): Implements the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
  - [KnapsackOutput.png](#lab-6-knapsackoutputpng): Sample output screenshot of the Knapsack solution.
