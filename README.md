## Introduction
This repository contains various programs implemented in C, aimed at understanding and applying advanced algorithmic techniques. The repository includes visual outputs for performance evaluation of different sorting algorithms.

## Program Structure
The repository is structured into different labs, each covering specific algorithmic techniques and implementations.

### Lab 2
- **Selection Sort Implementation**
  - [SelectionSort.c](Lab2/SelectionSort.c): Implements selection sort, allowing manual entry of array elements and evaluating time performance.
  - [SelectionSort.exe](Lab2/SelectionSort.exe): Executable file for Windows.
  - [SelectionSortGraph.pdf](Lab2/SelectionSortGraph.pdf): Performance graph showing execution time for various input sizes.
  - [SelectionSortOutput.png](Lab2/SelectionSortOutput.png): Sample output screenshot.

### Lab 3
- **Merge Sort Implementation**
  - [MergeSort.c](Lab3/MergeSort.c): Implements merge sort using the divide and conquer method.
  - [MergeSort.exe](Lab3/MergeSort.exe): Executable file for Windows.
  - [MergeSortGraph.pdf](Lab3/MergeSortGraph.pdf): Performance graph illustrating merge sort execution time.
  - [MergeSort_vs_SelectionSort_Graph.pdf](Lab3/MergeSort_vs_SelectionSort_Graph.pdf): Comparative graph analyzing merge sort versus selection sort performance.
